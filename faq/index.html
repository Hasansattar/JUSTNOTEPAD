<a name="4"></a>
<h3>Is it a text editor? Why there are no tools to format text?</h3>
<p>JustNotepad.com is a <strong>notepad</strong> – like a notepad on your device, but <strong>with a web&nbsp;interface</strong>. Therefore, JustNotepad.com has no purpose to function like a real text&nbsp;editor or word&nbsp;processor.</p>
<p>If you need a real multifunctional special text&nbsp;editor with text&nbsp;formatting tools etc., you can <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=download+text+editor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">find</a> a lot of different applications (any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_word_processors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Word&nbsp;processor</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Text&nbsp;editor</a>) for your special needs.<br />Or you can download and install, for example the free and open-source <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LibreOffice&nbsp;Writer</a> (for Windows, Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X and Linux).</p>
<a name="5"></a>
<h3>How to create a new text (another text)?</h3>
<p>To create a new text (draft) just press the “<strong>+&nbsp;New</strong>” button at the top of the web&nbsp;interface. It will open a new browser&nbsp;tab. Next, go to the new browser&nbsp;tab to begin writing a new text.</p>
<p>Note: Your previous text (draft) will be available as well, even if you have created a new text (draft). You can always switch between all your drafts (Links to all of your drafts is available below the text&nbsp;area, at any time and for your device only).</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<h3>How to delete my current draft (current text in the text&nbsp;area)?</h3>
<p>To delete your current text (which is displayed in the text&nbsp;area) just press the “<strong>Delete</strong>” button at the top of the web&nbsp;interface. Next, you need to confirm your action in a small pop-up window (using the “<strong>Delete</strong>” button again or “<strong>Cancel</strong>”).</p>
<p>Note: This action is irreversible. Your current text (draft) will be deleted completely. But other drafts (if&nbsp;exists) will be available as well, until you delete your other drafts too. Links to all of your drafts is available below the text&nbsp;area, at any time and for your device only.</p>
<a name="7"></a>
<h3>How to delete all my drafts completely (including the current text in the text&nbsp;area)?</h3>
<p>To delete all your drafts completely (including the current text in the text&nbsp;area) – just press the “<strong>Delete&nbsp;All&nbsp;Drafts</strong>” button (which is available below the text&nbsp;area). Next, you will need to confirm your action in a small pop-up window (using the “<strong>Delete</strong>” button, or “<strong>Cancel</strong>”).</p>
<p>Note: This action is irreversible. All your existing drafts (including your current text in the text&nbsp;area) will be deleted completely after this action.</p>
<a name="8"></a>
<h3>How can I get a list of all my drafts (old and new)?</h3>
<p>The list of all your drafts is available below the text&nbsp;area, at any time and for your device only. Each draft (in&nbsp;the&nbsp;drafts&nbsp;list) has a “last modification date” to easily identify draft.</p>
<a name="9"></a>
<h3>How to switch from the current draft (current text) to other draft?</h3>
<p>You can always switch between all your drafts by pressing the link of any draft in the drafts list (wich is available below the text&nbsp;area).<br />Also, you can use additional functionality of your web&nbsp;browser using several open “browser&nbsp;tabs” to use each draft (text) in a separate “browser&nbsp;tab”.</p>
<a name="10"></a>
<h3>Can I restore my text (draft), if I use the “Private&nbsp;Mode” in my browser?</h3>
<p>If you have set your browser to “Private&nbsp;Mode” or “Never&nbsp;remember&nbsp;history” you will not be able to restore any of your text (which is used in JustNotepad.com) after restarting the browser, because all your drafts will be deleted automatically from your Browser “Local&nbsp;storage” by the browser, according to the browser security settings for such mode. Please do not use the “Private&nbsp;Mode” or “Never&nbsp;remember&nbsp;history” in your browser if you want to use JustNotepad.com fully.</p>
<a name="11"></a>
<h3>I have restarted my browser, but my text disappeared. Why? :-(</h3>
<p>It seems that your web&nbsp;browser is set to “Private&nbsp;Mode” or “Never&nbsp;remember&nbsp;history”. Therefore, your text (draft) has been deleted automatically from your Browser “Local&nbsp;storage” by the web&nbsp;browser, according to the browser security settings for such mode. JustNotepad.com does not allow to restore your text (draft) after restarting your web&nbsp;browser for such browser mode. Please turn off the “Private&nbsp;Mode” or “Never&nbsp;remember&nbsp;history” in your web&nbsp;browser if you want to use the full functionality of the JustNotepad.com.</p>
<p>Also, the text could disappear, because you have not yet chosen a draft (after deleting the previous draft). List of all your drafts available below the text&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>In addition, if you use an older web&nbsp;browser – try to update your browser or install a new browser (For example – “<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/products" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mozilla&nbsp;Firefox</a>” or “<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google&nbsp;Chrome</a>” or “<a href="http://www.opera.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opera</a>” or “<a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Safari</a>”).</p>
<a name="12"></a>
<h3>Where are stored my drafts (texts)?</h3>
<p>Your drafts are stored in your Browser's “Local&nbsp;storage” (if it is technologically possible and is supported by a browser). “Local&nbsp;storage” is a location in temporary memory on your device which is available to your web&nbsp;browser. Therefore, your drafts (texts) are available for your browser only (on your device only). Therefore, JustNotepad.com does not store User's texts or drafts on its server.</p>
<p>The actual location of your Browser's “Local&nbsp;storage” depending on your browser. You can find details in communities of web&nbsp;browser support.</p>
<a name="13"></a>
<h3>How long will my drafts (texts) be available?</h3>
<p>Actually, it depends on the settings of your browser. If you use any top browser (like “Mozilla&nbsp;Firefox”, “Google&nbsp;Chrome”, “Apple&nbsp;Safari”, “Opera”, “Microsoft&nbsp;Edge”) with the default settings, then your drafts will be available to you until you clear your Browser's “Local&nbsp;storage” (Site date) for JustNotepad.com.</p>
<p>Note: The option “auto&nbsp;save” text (draft) is not designed as a service&nbsp;of&nbsp;backup of text, and any text can be deleted by the browser automatically (accidentally or intentionally).</p>
<a name="14"></a>
<h3>What is the maximum size of the text (draft) is available?</h3>
<p>Actually, it depends on your browser. Because your text (draft) is stored in your browser (on your device). Limits of Browser's “Local&nbsp;storage” depend on the browser. If the maximum storage space is used up, you'll get a notification from JustNotepad.com.</p>
<p>Note: If you have a lot of drafts (texts) or very large text, your browser can hang. To prevent it, you should delete unnecessary&nbsp;drafts (texts) and do not use very large text on JustNotepad.com.</p>
<a name="15"></a>
<h3>Can other users to see my private text? I don't want to show my text to anyone.</h3>
<p>No. Because your text (draft) is stored in your browser only (on your device only). JustNotepad.com does not store User's texts or drafts on its server.</p>
<a name="16"></a>
<h3>How to transfer my text (draft) to another device? I'd like to open my text on other device.</h3>
<p>To transfer your text (draft) to another device – just press the link “<strong>Create&nbsp;a&nbsp;Temporary&nbsp;Link for the current text</strong>” (at the top of the web&nbsp;interface). You will need to create a “Temporary&nbsp;link” for your current text (draft) via special form. Just add a password to protect your text (draft), and press the “<strong>Create&nbsp;Link</strong>” button. Next, copy the generated link. Now you can use your “Temporary&nbsp;link” on any other device to complete the syncing of your text (draft).</p>
<p>Note: Temporary&nbsp;link will be available for <strong>2&nbsp;hours&nbsp;only</strong>. Then your link will be deleted automatically.</p>
<a name="17"></a>
<h3>How to send my text (draft) to my friend?</h3>
<p>If you want to send your text (draft) to your friend, you can use the link “<strong>Create&nbsp;a&nbsp;Temporary&nbsp;Link for the current text</strong>” (at the top of the web&nbsp;interface). To complete the syncing of your text (draft) by your friend, your friend should know the password of your “Temporary&nbsp;link”.</p>
<p>Note: Temporary&nbsp;link will be available for <strong>2&nbsp;hours&nbsp;only</strong>. Then your link will be deleted automatically.</p>
<a name="18"></a>
<h3>Can I save my text “as&nbsp;.txt&nbsp;file” on my device?</h3>
<p>For now, JustNotepad.com does not have such functionality in the web&nbsp;interface. But if you use a desktop browser, you can try to use the functionality of your browser – via the menu button and select “<strong>Save&nbsp;page&nbsp;as...</strong>” or via the keyboard&nbsp;shortcuts – <strong><nobr>Ctrl+S</nobr></strong> or <strong><nobr>Cmd+S</nobr></strong>, and then select the file&nbsp;extension – as&nbsp;“<strong>.txt</strong>”</p>
